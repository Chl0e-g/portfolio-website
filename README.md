# Portfolio website

## Introduction
This project is a portfolio website I've created to display my work as a fullstack developer. In addition to having a primary function as my portfolio, I also used this project to learn SASS/SCSS and practice building fully responsive websites using a combination of CSS flexbox and media queries. I fully designed the website myself on Figma, and replicated my designs when building the site.
